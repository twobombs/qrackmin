## Overview

Qrackmin is a minimalistic container system for [Qrack](https://github.com/unitaryfund/qrack), designed for both OpenCL and CUDA environments. It provides a set of Docker images and scripts to run quantum computing simulations and benchmarks. ThereminQ orchestrates a suite of best-of-class tools designed to control extend and visualize data emanating for Quantum circuits using Qrack ELK Tipsy Jupyter CUDA and OpenCL accelerators.

## Directory Structure

Here's an overview of the main directories in this repository:

-   `benchmarks/`: Contains benchmark files for testing quantum simulations.
-   `deploy-scripts/`: Includes scripts for deploying and managing the containerized environment, especially for VCL clusters.
-   `dockerfiles/`: A collection of Dockerfiles to build various container images tailored for different environments and purposes (e.g., AWS, CUDA, OpenCL, Python).
-   `run-scripts/`: A variety of scripts to execute different quantum simulation tasks and benchmarks within the containers.

## Dockerfiles

The `dockerfiles/` directory contains a variety of Dockerfiles to build container images for different environments and purposes. Here's a breakdown of the most important ones:

| Dockerfile                        | Purpose                                                                                             |

## Docker Deployments

### `latest`

The `:latest` container image is meant to be used on a single node with Nvidia-Docker2 and Linux support.

```bash
docker run --gpus all --device=/dev/kfd --device=/dev/dri:/dev/dri --privileged -d twobombs/qrackmin[:tag] [--memory 24G --memory-swap 250G]
```

-   To save measured results outside the container, use the volume flag: `-v /var/log/qrack:/var/log/qrack`.
-   To get a shell inside the container:

```bash
docker exec -ti [containerID] bash
```

-   The ThereminQ repo with runfiles is checked out at `/root`.
-   Windows users should install `WSL2`, `Docker Desktop`, `docker.io`, and `nvidia-docker2` to run this (`CUDA` only).

## Run Scripts

The `run-scripts/` directory contains various scripts to execute simulations and benchmarks. You can run these scripts from within the appropriate Docker container. For example, to run a qbdd benchmark:

1.  Start the `qbdd` container.
2.  Get a shell inside the container.
3.  Navigate to the `/root/thereminq/run-scripts` directory.
4.  Execute the desired script, e.g., `./run-qbdd`.

Please refer to the individual scripts for more details on their usage.

## VCL Cluster Setup

Qrackmin can be deployed as a VCL cluster for distributed computing.

#### On the host, the following directory structure needs to be created:

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /var/log/vcl/etc/vcl/ /var/log/vcl/etc/init.d /var/log/vcl/usr/bin /var/log/vcl/etc/rc0.d /var/log/vcl/etc/rc1.d /var/log/vcl/etc/rc2.d /var/log/vcl/etc/rc3.d /var/log/vcl/etc/rc4.d /var/log/vcl/etc/rc5.d /var/log/vcl/etc/rc6.d
```

#### 1. Run the VCL Nodes

Run the bash script in `/run-scripts/` in this repository called `./1-run-nodes`. You will be asked two questions:
-   The amount of virtual nodes you want to create.
-   The NVIDIA devices you want to expose (often 'all' will suffice, otherwise use the device number).

*Other OpenCL device types such as an Intel IGP that are also recognised will also be taken into the cluster.*

#### 2. Run the VCL Host

When you've deployed enough backend containers to your liking, you can start `./2-run-host`.
-   The nodes' IPs will be scraped.
-   The host container will be started and will initialize.
-   You'll drop into the host-container's bash.
-   Then run workloads through `./vcl-1.25/vclrun [command]`.

---

#### A Full VDI host experience is available in [`ThereminQ:vcl-controller`](https://github.com/twobombs/thereminq#to-run-thereminq-as-a-virtualcl-controller)

#### Follow the guide for running [`VCL`](https://mosix.cs.huji.ac.il/txt_vcl.html) in a cluster [here](https://mosix.cs.huji.ac.il/vcl/VCL_Guide.pdf).

#### For multi-host setup please look [`Docker Swarm`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/swarm-tutorial/create-swarm/) and [`Zerotier`](https://www.zerotier.com/).
